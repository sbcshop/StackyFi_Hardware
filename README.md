StackyFi is an innovative standalone mini-controller board designed with the Raspberry Pi Zero physical factor and powered by the powerful ESP32-S3 WROOM 1 microcontroller. StackyFi eliminates the requirement for a Raspberry Pi board by effortlessly supporting most Raspberry Pi HATs, allowing you to stack them directly on its tiny frame. The device includes an integrated 6D MEMS IMU, RGB LED, camera integration, and wireless connectivity such as WiFi and BluetoothÂ® 5 (LE). StackyFi is ideal for your next-generation IoT prototype projects, spanning from smart home applications to security and surveillance systems.
